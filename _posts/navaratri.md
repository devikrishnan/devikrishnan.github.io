“Nava”  means nine and “Ratri” means night, hence Navaratri is the festival celebrated over nine nights. The Navaratri has begun and I thought of making my debut blog post an auspicious one by writing about it. 🙂

Navaratri for me during my schools was always associated with the happiness of getting a ten-day break from school. But let me now throw some light into the beautiful aspects of this festival. It is celebrated in different parts of our country for different reasons, but the essence is same and powerful in all – victory of good over evil. It is believed that Goddess Durga battles with the asura(demon) Mahishasura and emerges victorious to restore Dharma. It is also celebrated as a victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana.

In the first three nights, Goddess Durga is worshipped, in the next three Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped and in the last three days, Goddess Durga is worshipped. The beauty of this festival is the inner meaning of celebrating it. Goddess Durga symbolizes the Shakti which destroys the negative tendencies within us. She is called Mahishasura Mardini – the destroyer of Mahishasura, the asura, where Mahishasura represents the negative tendencies in us, like laziness, ignorance, ego etc.

But just by destroying the negativities in us, we are not immune to it, hence to purify our mind and to  instill positive qualities we worship Goddess Lakshmi- the giver of wealth and prosperity, where the wealth is not the material wealth that we usually associate it with but is the spiritual values that we inculcate.

In the last three days, we worship Goddess Saraswati- the Goddess of knowledge. After eliminating negative tendencies and instilling positive values in us, we must attain the knowledge of the self which is the highest knowledge. The ninth day is the day of Ayudha Puja where we worship the tools that we use in our daily life. For students, it’s the books they use for studying and that’s why it was my favorite day of the whole year. As it is the only time nobody will persuade you to study (:P).  On the tenth day, we do Saraswati Puja and Vidhyarambham to get the blessings of Goddess Saraswati.

Goddess Durga, Lakshmi, and Saraswati are not different but the different aspects of divinity. Navarathri has already started and let’s not miss out on understanding the spiritual values that the festival symbolizes. We should eliminate the negative tendencies and inculcate positive values in us, only then will there be a true victory of good over evil!
