I believe 2018 is going to be one hell of a year. The fact that I was moving to Finland for completing my last semester at Aalto University added to it. I arrived at Helsinki on Jan 2nd and the temperature then turned out to be around 5-degree Celsius which is around 25 degrees lesser than the normal temperature at the place that I come from! And hence, that proved to be the first challenge that I had to face in 2018 and I’m glad that I had someone to share my misery with, my classmate/roommate of four years, Athira :D.

Setting aside the trouble adapting to the cold climate over here, I was finding it more difficult to adapt to the very silent environment all of over. Coming from a quite loud/happening place, I found it quite strange and monotonous. Also, the tedious process of putting on so many layers before leaving for a place was also something that I was not quite used to. All that pretty much sums up the difficulties I initially faced, but my journey so far in Finland has been endearing!

The first week was spent mostly with the orientation program at the University and getting to know the public facilities at Finland like the transportation system, health care, student concessions etc. We were guided by our tutors from the University through all the procedures at the university and they accompanied us to get our travel cards etc. By the beginning of the second week, I was facing the side effects of sudden temperature change- caught hold of throat infection! :/ The two moments in which you really feel homesick is either when you fall sick or when you have food cooked by yourself because these are the two times that we really miss our mother! Initially, every day felt like a challenge as over here everything was to be done by myself, be it cooking, taking care of health, waking up early, managing expenses, dealing with challenges etc. In a way, I feel the whole experience I've had so far and that is yet to come during my stay is going to make a better and stronger person! :)

My time so far being here got even better after meeting some wonderful people from Amma’s Satsang group at Helsinki (perks of being an Amritian :D). They are one of the most generous, lively lot of people we’ve met here so far!

Experiences so far, in a nutshell, would be -

Climate: Mostly it is cloudy and dark. We don’t see daylight until it’s 9-10 in the morning. We are so used to waking up to a bright morning that waking up to a dark night-like morning is difficult.  It was amazing to see snow for the first time in my life but the excitement died down pretty soon as it was too cold :D. Snowy days are way better than cold windy days!  Looking forward to a warmer spring ahead! |B

People: The people here are very polite and helpful, but they are super quiet. Generally, it’s very quiet everywhere, be it metro or inside the bus.

Cooking: It's a daily reminder of how much I should've paid attention to my mother when she cooked. More than us I think our mothers have become busier than before after we moved here, as they are on constant emergency alert, be it for cooking or health-related issues :) Apart from the one time I tried making aloo tikki, every other dish had been successful so far.

University: The university is a bit far from where we stay, hence we need to take a metro to reach there. But the transportation here is quite easy as there'll be a metro every 2 mins. It’s way colder at the university as it is situated near to the sea :/

Work: I will be working on some courses during my last semester at Aalto. The coursework so far works pretty differently as compared to how it was at my home university. Most of the courses that I've taken up heavily depends on assignments and homework rather than exams ( which, I find very cool! :D ).

Hoping to have a fruitful and happy time ahead! :)
